  I have been working though C For Programmers from Dietel. Its been good but I is lacking exercise problems to solve this I have paused
  that book and stated working through C How To Program, also from Dietel. I am only going to use this one as a means of exercises. Seeing
  how they are the same author the go hand in hand. You can see all the exercise projects in the dietel folder.

  Im going to put a temporary pause on the books to work thought a couple of Test-Driven Development courses on Lynda. I feel like it      
  would be a good idea to learn about this and implement test as a also do these c exercises.
