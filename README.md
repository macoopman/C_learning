  I have been working though C For Programmers from Dietel. Its been good but I is lacking exercise problems to solve this I have paused
  that book and stated working through C How To Program, also from Dietel. I am only going to use this one as a means of exercises. Seeing
  how they are the same author the go hand in hand. You can see all the exercise projects in the dietel folder.
